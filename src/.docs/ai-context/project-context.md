# Project Context and Goals

## Project Vision

A modern, mobile-first fantasy name generator that creates linguistically consistent names for fantasy worlds, characters, and places. Names should feel like they belong to the same fictional language or culture.

## Core Problem

Fantasy writers, game masters, and world-builders need names that sound cohesive and belong to the same fictional language. Random name generators often produce inconsistent results that break immersion.

## Solution Approach

Use syllable-based generation with linguistic patterns and rules, powered by seedrandom for reproducible results. Each "language" has defined syllable groups and combination patterns that create consistent phonetic styles.

## Target Users

-  **Fantasy writers** creating consistent world-building
-  **Game masters** needing NPC and location names
-  **World builders** developing fictional cultures
-  **Game developers** populating fantasy worlds

## Key Features

-  Multiple fantasy languages with distinct phonetic styles
-  Mobile-first responsive design for on-the-go use
-  Seedable random generation for reproducible results
-  Batch name generation for efficiency
-  Name history and favorites
-  Language customization and creation

## User Experience Goals

-  **Immediate usability** - Generate names with one tap
-  **Mobile optimized** - Primary use case is mobile device
-  **Fast and responsive** - No loading delays
-  **Intuitive interface** - Clear purpose and actions
-  **Consistent results** - Same seed produces same names

## Technical Goals

-  **Performance** - Fast name generation and rendering
-  **Scalability** - Handle large language datasets
-  **Maintainability** - Clean, documented codebase
-  **Extensibility** - Easy to add new languages
-  **Accessibility** - Usable by all users

## Success Metrics

-  Names feel linguistically consistent within each language
-  Mobile experience is smooth and fast
-  Users can easily generate multiple names quickly
-  Languages are clearly distinct from each other
-  Code is maintainable and well-structured

## Future Expansion

-  User-created custom languages
-  Name meaning generation
-  Export functionality for generated names
-  Integration with writing/gaming tools
-  Community sharing of languages
